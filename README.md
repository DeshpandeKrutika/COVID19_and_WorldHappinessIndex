# Happiness in the Age of Pandemic: Uncovering Patterns in World Happiness and COVID-19

This project combines two datasets - World Happiness Index Report 2021 and COVID-19 data. 

## World Happiness Report 2021

The World Happiness Report 2021 focuses on the effects of COVID-19 and how people all over the world have fared. The aim was two-fold, first to focus on the effects of COVID-19 on the structure and quality of peopleâ€™s lives, and second to describe and evaluate how governments all over the world have dealt with the pandemic. In particular, they try to explain why some countries have done so much better than others.
